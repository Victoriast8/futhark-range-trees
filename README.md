## Interval Trees in Futhark
This project is about implementing interval trees in futhark using PAMs (Parallel Augmented Maps).

The project's original purpose is to seek an answer to the question: "Are PAMs suitable for data-parallel construction of interval trees?", however we may find another road along the way.

## What are PAMs?
Here's an article about PAMs: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3200691.3178509 \
This project is using PAMs as mentioned in the article.


### Who are we and why this project?
I am a bachelor student writing this project as part of my bachelor project, which is supervised by Troels Henriksen. \
The project idea came from Troels and is interesting to us, as a field of research; are PAMs efficient in Futhark? Should the usage of PAMs in Futhark be endorsed or discouraged?

We hope to answer some of these questions through this project.
